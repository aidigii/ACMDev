This project calls an API, passing a string name into a parameter called value. 

Some notes: 
*My name is hardcoded into the project, and you can observe a delay on my name
whenever the page is re-rendered due to the asychronous nature of react. *
*Created with React (using create-react-app, did not manually install 
dependencies) and used axios to call the API. *

Main code can be found in the src folder under App.js

#### How to run ####
Under the appropriate directory, run "npm start"
